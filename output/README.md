# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the history of philosophy

### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

Those results are coming from the main coding file, and might be used without re-run some of the cells since it might take too much time.

To be noticed, the file philosophy_data_new.csv' and  'philosophy_data_dominantTopic.csv'  are not included in this folder since they are too large. If you would like to re-run the project, contact me for those!
